# Password_Manager
## Overview
This is a Tkinter GUI App.
## Features
1. The 'Email/Username' field should be already populated with the default emailid we use on a daily basis.
2. The 'Website' field should be entered depending upon for which website the user needs the login credentials.
3. The user can enter the password on their own or can click on the 'Generate Password' button in order to populate the field automatically.
4. If any of the fields is empty, a window will pop up so that the user should always enter details into the respective fields.
5. After all the details are entered the user can click on the 'Add' button so that the details get written into a text file called 'data.txt'.
